# No-U-Turn-Sampler
Code for the No U-Turn Sampler, implemented as a project for STAT 31511: Monte Carlo Simulation at the University of Chicago.

The code is provided as a Jupyter Notebook in `src/NUTS_Implementation.ipynb`. Included in the Jupyter Notebook are two replications of plots in the original paper by Hoffman and Gelman ([linked here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4246)).

Included in `reports/Final_Paper.pdf` is a writeup of the project, which is capped at 10 pages in accordance with course instructions.
